Ludum Dare 46 : Keep Coron Alive

This game is about helping a well known virus to survive.

Each level starts with a single sick person. Without action, this person will heal (or die in rare cases), preventing the virus to spread.</p>

The game consists in selecting an attack in the left panel, then clicking a sick person (red face) on the screen, trying to contaminate other people.</p>
A level is successful when there is at least one living sick person in the game at the end of the countdown.

*Disclaimer*:
This game is a way to show the effects of people moves and lockdowns during a contagion, not an incentive to see people get sick or die.
